            Hi, I'm Anvita. I live in Somerville, MA. I'm a software dev and an aspiring writer.<br/><br/>
 
	    My favorite writers are Malcolm Muggeridge, Ursula Le Guin, Douglas Adams, Milan Kundera, Nicole Krauss, Rachel Kushner, Jillian Lauren, and Alan Moore (did you know he's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57903929">still publishing!</a>). Reach out to me at panditanvita (Gmail) if you're interested in workshopping fiction, or in discussing the craft of novel-writing.
<br/><br/>

            From 2017-2023, I was at Google. In my last year, I was project lead on a software monitoring system for instrumenting dynamic usage of internal and open-source cryptographic libraries, such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink</a>. This exposes new sources of data to answer questions like "How many total bytes has this cryptographic key encrypted, and is it ready to be retired?" for keys that have been broadly distributed on the client-side.<br/><br/>
            
	    I presented the cryptography monitoring project at <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/high-availability-google-key-management/">QCon San Francisco (2022)</a>. Anne Kim and I co-presented a talk on genetics testing algorithms and their pitfalls when it comes to sorting ethnicity, at DEFCON Biohacking Village (2019).
