            Hi, I'm Anvita. I live in Cambridge-Somerville, MA and I'm working on writing a speculative sci-fi novel. <br/><br/>
 
	    If you're a creative writer interested in workshopping together, I'm panditanvita on the Google mail domain. My writing interests are around globalism, identity, post-scarcity, post-sacred, everyday ethics, and culture in the age of brain-machine interfaces. I like lush, hyperrealistic and inventive prose.

            Previously, I was a senior software engineer at Google, where my most recent role was project lead on a software monitoring system for instrumenting dynamic usage of internal and open-source cryptographic libraries, such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink</a>. This will expose new sources of data, and allow answering questions such as "How many total bytes has this cryptographic key encrypted, and is it ready to be retired?" for keys that have been broadly distributed on the client-side.<br/><br/>
